# Machine-Learning-Linear-Regression-LAB-3

This repo contains Lab practices of Machine Learning performed in Jupyter Notebook using Python language

ðŸš€ LAB-3: Part-A: Simple Linear Regression

â—¾ LAB 3 Part A ipynb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the Simple Linear regression on a given data set and visualize the results. This code files uses the Salary_Data.csv dataset file to perform the Simple Linear regression and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.

ðŸš€ LAB-3: Part-B: Multiple Linear Regression

â—¾ LAB 3 Part B ipynb file consists of the basic python coding required to perform the Multiple Linear regression on a given data set and visualize the results. This code files uses the 50_Startups.csv dataset file to perform the Multiple Linear regression and Visualizes the results using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
